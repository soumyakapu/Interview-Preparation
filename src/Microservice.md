### What is Microservice?
- Microservice is a small,independent and modular service that are designed to perform specific task
### What are the three commonly used tools for Microservices?
- Docker,WireMock,Hysrix
### How does a Microservice architecture work?
- Microservice architecture consits of multiple modules which perform individual standalone task
- An application is fragmented as loosely coupled various modules,which each perform distinct function
###  What are the biggest challenges in Microservice deployment?
- the biggest challenges in microservice deployment in two ways i.e. technical,functional
- techincal ways :
- The components in microservices always rely on each other, so; it requires communication between them in the application.
 - There are also a lot of challenges in deployment.
 - Testing and Debugging are very challenging.
 - It requires complete component automation and application maintenance.
 - It receives heavy operations overhead.
 - It requires skilled professionals to support heterogeneously distributed microservices.
### What do you understand by Monolithic Architecture?
Monolithic architecture is like a big container that contains all the software components of an application. These applications are clubbed inside a single package within the application.
### What are the main differences between Microservices and Monolithic Architecture?
- the major difference between Microservice and monolithic are:
- Microservice: it is loosely coupled aricheture 
- if any change in the module it doesn't affect the other modules
- service startup is fast in microservice
- it mainly focus on the product but not on projects
- Monolithic : it is tightly coupled archiecture
- if any change in one module it affect the entire application
- service startup is slow in monolithic 
- it focus on whole project
